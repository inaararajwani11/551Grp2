# Team Work Contract

This document outlines the principles, logistics, and expectations that govern how our team collaborates on this project. The purpose of this contract is to establish clarity, accountability, and mutual respect in our working relationship.

This contract may only be modified with full agreement from all team members.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Work Distribution

We commit to distributing work fairly and transparently.

-   Tasks will be broken down into clearly defined issues.
-   Work will be assigned during meetings based on workload balance, individual strengths, and learning goals.
-   Core responsibilities (analysis, visualization, documentation, quality review) will rotate across milestones.
-   No member should consistently carry a disproportionate share of responsibility.

If workload imbalance is observed, the team will address it immediately and redistribute tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Expected Time Commitment

Each team member agrees to dedicate approximately:

-   4–6 hours per week to the project
-   Additional time during milestone deadlines if necessary

If a member anticipates reduced availability, they must notify the team at least 48 hours in advance so that planning adjustments can be made.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Meeting Structure and Frequency

-   We will meet once per week at a scheduled time.
-   Additional short coordination meetings may be scheduled before major deadlines.

Each meeting will include:

1.  Brief progress updates from each member
2.  Identification of blockers
3.  Task assignment for the upcoming week
4.  Clarification of technical or design decisions

Meeting duration will typically be 45–60 minutes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Agendas and Minutes

-   A meeting agenda will be prepared before each meeting.
-   One team member will take notes during the meeting.
-   These responsibilities will rotate weekly.
-   Meeting notes will summarize decisions, assigned tasks, and deadlines.

This ensures transparency and shared understanding.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Working Style

Our working style emphasizes:

-   Clear communication
-   Small, incremental progress
-   Accountability before deadlines

We will:

-   Track tasks using GitHub issues.
-   Submit changes through pull requests instead of pushing directly to the main branch.
-   Review each other’s contributions before merging.

We do not require daily stand-ups, but each member will provide a short written progress update at least 4 hours before weekly meetings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Communication Expectations

Primary communication channel: WhatsApp group chat

Expectations:

-   Messages should be acknowledged within 24 hours.
-   Important decisions must be documented in writing.
-   Respectful and constructive communication is required at all times.

Disagreements should focus on ideas, not individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Quality Standards

Each team member agrees to:

-   Write clean and readable code.
-   Ensure that visualizations are accurate and clearly labeled.
-   Test all contributions locally before submission.
-   Proofread written documentation.
-   Deliver work that reflects professional-level standards.

Incomplete or rushed work that affects the team’s overall quality will be discussed openly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Availability and Constraints

Each member will clearly communicate recurring unavailable times (e.g. evenings, family commitments, work shifts).

We will avoid last-minute reliance on any single member by planning ahead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Conflict Resolution

If conflict arises:

1.  The issue will first be discussed privately and respectfully between involved members.
2.  If unresolved, it will be discussed in a full team meeting.
3.  If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will be used.
4.  If necessary, the instructor may be consulted for guidance.

Personal attacks, dismissive behavior, or avoidance of responsibility will not be tolerated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Accountability and Responsibility

All members are collectively responsible for the final submission.

If a member repeatedly fails to meet agreed commitments:

-   The issue will be addressed privately.\
-   Responsibilities may be reassigned temporarily.
-   Persistent issues will be documented and escalated if necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Contract Updates

This contract may only be updated if all team members agree to the revision.

Any changes must be documented in the repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By participating in this project, each team member agrees to uphold these principles in good faith.
