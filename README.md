DATA 551: Dataviz II

Welcome to DATA 551!

In this course you will be working in a team of 3-4 students with the goal of designing a dashboard for interactive data visualization, exploration, and communication. You will start by choosing a realistic scenario for your dashboard (target audience, dataset, etc), and then you will design a prototype which will receive feedback from your peers which you will implement in the next lab.

We will be using Dash for building the dashboard in both R and Python, together with the visualization libraries you learnt in 531 to create effective data visualizations that strengthen our own exploratory data analysis skills and our ability to communicate insights to others.

## Course Learning Outcomes

You will learn how to

1. Make effective design choices for interactive visualizations and dashboards.
2. Apply purpose-driven dashboard design.
3. Extract insight from dashboards to answer research questions.
4. Implement interactive visualizations and dashboard components using Plotly's Dash, ggplotly and Altair.
5. Use Heroku or other platforms to deploy interactive dashboards publicly.
6. Design and follow a teamworking contract.
7. Provide actionable feedback to your peers and address feedback provided to you.
