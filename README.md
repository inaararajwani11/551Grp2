### Healthcare Survey Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the Healthcare Survey Dataset to uncover insights regarding public health trends, mental health states, and lifestyle factors. Our team is developing an interactive dashboard to make these complex data relationships accessible and actionable for health researchers and policymakers.

# 📝 Important Project Notes

# 🎯 Motivation and Purpose

Role: We are acting as a data science consultancy firm providing tools for healthcare administrators.

Target Audience: Health care administrators and policy makers looking to understand factors that lead to specific health outcomes.

Problem Solved: Reducing the difficulty of interpreting high-dimensional health survey data by allowing users to identify common factors contributing to patient health status.

# 💾 Description of the Data

Dimensions: The dataset contains 108,252 rows and 50 columns.

Demographics: Key variables include Province, Gender, Age, Edu_level, and Total_income.

Health Indicators: Features include Gen_health_state, Mental_health_state, Stress_level, and Life_satisfaction.

Chronic Conditions: Tracks diagnoses for High_BP, Diabetic, Mood_disorder, and Anxiety_disorder.

Lifestyle & Behavior: Includes Physical_vigorous_act_time, weekly_alcohol, Cannabies_use, and Fruit_veg_con.

# 🔍 Research Questions and Usage Scenarios

Research Focus: How do lifestyle factors like vigorous activity and fruit/vegetable consumption correlate with self-reported mental health and stress levels?

Usage Scenario: A policy maker can explore the dataset to compare the effect of different variables on health utility indexes and identify groups most in need of intervention.

Regional Analysis: Users can filter data by province to observe geographical disparities in chronic condition prevalence and healthcare insurance coverage.

# 📱 Description of App & Sketch

Interface Design: The app will contain a landing page with visual distributions (bar charts, density charts) of health factors.(dashboard)

Interactivity: Users can filter the display by demographics (e.g., only female patients) or by specific health metrics using dropdown menus.

Technical Stack: The dashboard is being developed in Python using Dash and Altair for interactive visualizations.

# 🚀 Milestone Roadmap

Milestone 1: Finalize scenario, dataset, target audience, and dashboard sketch.

Milestone 2: Create and deploy a functional prototype dashboard in Python.

Milestone 3: Design a user feedback survey and conduct experience testing.

Milestone 4: Implement feedback and finalize the production-ready dashboard.
