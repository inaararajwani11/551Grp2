# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Expected Behaviour

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on what is best for the community and the project.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by opening an issue in the
