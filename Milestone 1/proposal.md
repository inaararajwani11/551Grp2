Section 2: Description of the data

We will visualize a Canadian healthcare survey dataset with 108,252 observations and 50 variables, where each row represents one respondent. The dataset includes (1) demographic and socioeconomic attributes (e.g., age group, sex/gender, geography, education/income-related indicators), (2) health status and chronic-condition indicators, and (3) lifestyle and behavioral factors (e.g., smoking and physical activity). Many fields are stored as numeric codes and include special response values (e.g., “valid skip”, “don’t know”, “refused”, “not stated”). We will use the accompanying codebook to map coded values to human-readable categories and to convert non-substantive codes into NA/“Unknown” before building the visualizations.

Given the large number of columns, we will focus on a smaller set of variables that supports our dashboard’s main goal: exploring how key health outcomes vary across population groups and behaviors. Our planned visualizations will emphasize differences in outcome distributions across age/sex/region and their association with lifestyle factors (especially smoking and physical activity). We will also derive a small number of new variables to simplify interpretation, such as standardized “Unknown/NA” categories, grouped activity levels derived from activity frequency/time fields, and summary indicators (e.g., a count or composite index of selected health risk factors/conditions) where appropriate.
